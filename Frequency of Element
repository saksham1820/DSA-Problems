Given a vector of N positive integers and an integer X. The task is to find the frequency of X in vector.

Input:
N = 5
vector = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
X = 1
Output: 
5
Explanation: Frequency of 1 is 5.

Solution:
int findFrequency(vector<int> v, int x){
    int freq = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++){
        if(v[i] == x){
            freq++;
        }
    }
    return freq;
