Given an array, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.
 
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
5 1 2 3 4

Solution:
void rotate(int arr[], int n)
{
    int pointer = n-1;
    int temp = arr[pointer];
    while(pointer>0){
        arr[pointer] = arr[pointer-1];
        pointer--;
    }
    arr[0] = temp;
}
