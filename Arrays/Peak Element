An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Possible Answer: 2
Generated Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.
If 2 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.

class Solution
{
    public:
    int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
    {
        int max_idx = 0, max_el = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(arr[i] > max_el){
                max_el = arr[i];
                max_idx = i;
            }
        }
        return max_idx;
       // Your code here
    }
};
